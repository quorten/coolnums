This is some very simple software written to compute triangular
numbers and square pyramidal numbers.

Dependencies
------------

This is the configuration where primary development and testing was
performed:

* Windows XP Media Center Edition
* MinGW32 GCC 3.4.5
* GMP 4.2.4
* Python 2.5.2

Although the C++ code was written for Windows, it can run on any
Unix-like operating system with minor modifications.

Background Info
---------------

Back in the day, in the year 2009, when computers were rarer and more
expensive than they are nowadays (they were already a lot cheaper than
they were 20 years ago!), I was running this software on a shared
Windows XP home desktop computer system (manufactured in 2007) and had
to take steps to make sure I saved the progress proper if someone else
came to the computer and closed the console window.  Of course,
nowadays in the year 2020, running this on a Unix-like server without
having a console window show up couldn't be easier.

Also, for me as a learning experience, this was my first experience
actually consciously using MinGW.  Although I've used it before in the
year 2004, it was buried beneath the Bloodshed Dev-C++ IDE GUI so as
to make it invisible.  It was also my first experience programming
against the GNU Multiple Precision (GMP) bignum library.

Again, good help was harder to find back then than it is today.
